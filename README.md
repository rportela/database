# üåê Revised SaaS Plan (Cloud-Agnostic)

## Phase 0 ‚Äî Architecture & Design Decisions

### Objective:
Freeze the high-level architecture and document the design principles.

### Key Choices:

**Data plane:**

- Primary store: Apache Iceberg tables on object storage (start with GCS, but abstract for S3/Azure later).
- Query engine: DuckDB (embedded), with a pluggable interface to add Trino/BigQuery/Snowflake in future.

**Control plane / metadata:**

- Firebase Authentication (JWT, OAuth providers)
- Firestore (client metadata, per-client entitlements, API keys)
- Security rules enforced per client_id.

**Frontend:**

- React + Vite single-page app.
- Use Firebase client SDK for login and Firestore access.

**Billing:**

- Stripe Checkout + Billing Portal.
- Firestore stores subscription state.
- Webhooks update entitlements in near real-time.

### Deliverables:

- `/docs/architecture/overview.md` ‚Äî diagrams + flows (auth, query, billing).
- `/docs/adr/` ‚Äî decisions on Iceberg, DuckDB, Firebase, Stripe, extensibility.

**Component diagram with clean separation:**

- Frontend (React)
- API Gateway (Cloud Run or similar)
- Query Engine Service (DuckDB)
- Catalog Service (Iceberg REST or custom)

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Infrastructure & CI/CD

### Objective:
Set up reproducible infrastructure for GCP, with portability in mind.

### Deliverables:

- Terraform (or Pulumi) for:
  - GCS buckets: iceberg-data, iceberg-metadata, stripe-webhook-logs.
  - Service accounts + roles for Cloud Run, Firestore, Stripe webhooks.
  - Artifact Registry for container images.

- GitHub Actions workflows:
  - Build & push container images.
  - Deploy to staging automatically; production with manual approval.

### Notes:

- Abstract storage layer: define a small interface in code for "object store" operations (read/write/list) so you can swap GCS for S3/Azure later.

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Authentication & Client Model

### Objective:
Enable secure login, per-client data isolation, and client metadata management.

### Deliverables:

- Firebase Auth setup (email/password, Google OAuth).
- Firestore structure and access patterns documented in `/docs/architecture/authentication-client-model.md`.
- Firestore security rules (`firestore.rules`) enforcing per-client isolation and owner-only access to billing.
